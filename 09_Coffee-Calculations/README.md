# Coffee Calculations

## What You'll Do

You and a group of friends have spent all day hanging out at a coffee shop. Each person has ordered some number of coffees, and you want to pay the entire bill.

Given an array of integers > 0 representing the number of coffees each friend ordered, calculate the total price of all coffees. Each coffee costs `$1.25`.

## Requirements

- Use array.reduce()
- Use template literals
