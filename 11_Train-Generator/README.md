# Train Stops

## What You'll Do

Create a generator function called `getStop` which yields different stops on the train line from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Station.

The stops are as follows:

- Poughkeepsie
- Newburgh
- Peekskill
- Yonkers
- Bronx
- Grand Central

You will have a button with an id of `next-stop` that, when clicked, will console log the next stop or if the end of the line has been reached will console log "We made it!"

## Requirements

- Use a generator function

## Output

- `Poughkeepsie`
- `Newburgh`
- `Peekskill`
- `Yonkers`
- `Bronx`
- `Grand Central`
- `We made it!`
