# Technical Books

## What You'll Do

Expanding on your previous book application you now want to create a class for technical books. Using the Book class constructed in the last example, extend the functionality to the new TechnicalBook class.

The new TechnicalBook class will take a book edition as a fifth argument.

You should add a getEdition method which prints `The current version of this book is ${version}`.

## Requirements

- Use JavaScript's class notation

## Instructions

- `Low stock`
- `In stock`
- `Out of stock`
- `Low stock`
- `The current version of this book is 2.3`
